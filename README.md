<summary>2. The FizzBuzz problem in ABAP</summary>

🚀 This ABAP program called [FIZZBUZZ_PROBLEM](/src/zabaptb_fizzbuzz_problem.prog.abap) was initially crafted in just about 10 minutes – ask me if I got the job? 😎 It meets the requirements of the FizzBuzz problem in ABAP and allows comparison between the [original implementation](https://github.com/netsrak-dev/abapToolbox/blob/9820c4bf60f0591e4027338eb3775a787c52d1b4/src/zabaptb_fizzbuzz_problem.prog.abap#L71C1-L83C9) and an [improved version](https://github.com/netsrak-dev/abapToolbox/blob/9820c4bf60f0591e4027338eb3775a787c52d1b4/src/zabaptb_fizzbuzz_problem.prog.abap#L92C1-L113C9) based on suggestions from ChatGPT. 💻

The concept is simple: Numbers from 1 to 100 are printed according to these rules:

- Multiples of 3 are replaced by "Fizz.
- Multiples of 5 are replaced by "Buzz.
- Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced by "FizzBuzz.

Inspired by Jeff Atwood's influential blog post "[Why Can't Programmers.. Program?](https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/)" this program aims to demonstrate effective programming skills in ABAP and invites contributions and feedback for further enhancements. Explore the differences between the original and improved logic! This project not only showcases effective ABAP programming but also encourages comparing and analyzing different implementations. Feedback and contributions for further development are warmly welcomed. 🌟
